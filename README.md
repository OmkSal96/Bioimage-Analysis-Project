# Bioimage-Analysis-Project

This repository contains a small project I conducted with my colleagues for the course 'Bioimage Analysis'.

We used images of a testing strip containing control and test bands and using skimage packages, tried to create a profile in order to detect the test band intensity above a certain threshold.
